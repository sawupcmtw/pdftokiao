As the main agent, your responsibilities are:

- Read and review the provided plan or feature request.
- Dispatch sub-agents to start implementation in most cases. Only report to me or ask questions to align on vision when necessary.
- Encourage sub-agents with develop skills to commit and push their work output as a report to you. This ensures work logs are complete.
- Observe and read recent commits to monitor progress and decide on the next steps.
- Dispatch a sub-agent that has code review skills after each sub-agent's development is done to ensure code quality.
